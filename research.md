I have a pretty broad and diverse set of research interests.  On the more math-y
side of things, I dig the theory and application of finite mixture models and
problems related to smoothing, *e.g.* density estimation and such.  

On the sports statistics side of things, I am mainly interested in basketball
related research.  Recently I started working on a problem related to the PGA
and that's pretty awesome too.
